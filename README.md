# ESP32 IR Transmitter Sensor Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an IR LED with an ESP32 microcontroller to transmit infrared signals. IR transmitters are commonly used for remote control applications where devices need to send commands to other IR receivers.

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- IR LED (Infrared LED)
- Resistor (appropriate value for IR LED)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the IR LED to ESP32:**
   - Connect the anode (longer leg) of the IR LED to GPIO pin 17 on the ESP32 through a current-limiting resistor.
   - Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the IR LED to ground (GND) of the ESP32.

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize the IR transmitter using the IRremoteESP8266 library and create an IRsend object in the `setup()` function.
   - Begin serial communication at a baud rate of 115200 to monitor IR signal transmission.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Use `irsend.sendNEC()` (or other protocol function) to transmit IR signals.
     - Specify the IR protocol (NEC, Sony, etc.), the 32-bit address, and command to be sent.
     - Print "IR signal sent!" to the Serial Monitor upon successful transmission.
     - Use `delay()` to wait between sending signals to prevent flooding the IR receiver.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **IR LED Orientation:** Ensure correct polarity (anode and cathode) when connecting the IR LED to the ESP32.
   - **Signal Strength:** Adjust the current-limiting resistor value for optimal IR LED performance and signal range.
   - **Protocol Compatibility:** Verify that the IR receiver device supports the IR protocol used for transmission (e.g., NEC, Sony, etc.).

## Applications
- **Remote Control Systems:** Transmit commands to IR receiver devices such as TVs, air conditioners, or multimedia systems.
- **Automation:** Integrate into home automation projects for IR-based control of appliances.
- **IR Data Transmission:** Send data between ESP32 devices or other IR-compatible systems.

## Notes
- **IR Library:** Utilize the IRremoteESP8266 library for simplified IR signal transmission.
- **Signal Verification:** Test IR signals with compatible receivers to ensure proper functionality and compatibility.
- **Serial Output:** Monitor IR signal transmission details and debugging messages using the Serial Monitor interface.
